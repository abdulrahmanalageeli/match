# History Feature Implementation

## Overview
The history feature has been updated to only show matches that have been completed (feedback given), rather than showing all matches including current and future ones.

## Changes Made

### 1. New API Endpoints
- **`/api/save-feedback.mjs`**: Saves user feedback and marks matches as completed
- **Updated `/api/get-my-matches.mjs`**: Added `history_only` parameter to filter completed matches

### 2. Database Tables
Two new tables need to be created:

#### `match_feedback` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS match_feedback (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    match_id UUID NOT NULL,
    participant_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    round INTEGER NOT NULL,
    enjoyment TEXT,
    connection TEXT,
    would_meet_again TEXT,
    overall_rating TEXT,
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(match_id, participant_number, round)
);
```

#### `match_completions` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS match_completions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    match_id UUID NOT NULL,
    participant_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    round INTEGER NOT NULL,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(match_id, participant_number, round)
);
```

### 3. UI Changes
- **History Button**: Redesigned as a standalone button beneath the compatibility score with a cool gradient design
- **History Modal**: Updated to show "سجل اللقاءات المكتملة" (Completed Meetings History)
- **Feedback Integration**: When users submit feedback, the match is automatically marked as completed

## How It Works

1. **Match Creation**: When matches are created, they are stored in `match_results` table
2. **Feedback Submission**: When users submit feedback, it's saved to `match_feedback` and the match is marked as completed in `match_completions`
3. **History Display**: The history button only shows matches that exist in `match_completions` table

## Setup Instructions

1. **Run Database Migration**: Execute the SQL commands in `database-migration.sql` in your Supabase database
2. **Deploy API Changes**: The new API endpoints will be automatically deployed
3. **Test the Feature**: 
   - Create some matches
   - Have users submit feedback
   - Check that history only shows completed matches

## Example Flow

1. User #1 matches with User #3 in Round 1
2. They have their conversation and submit feedback
3. The match is marked as completed
4. User #1 matches with User #5 in Round 2
5. They have their conversation and submit feedback
6. The second match is marked as completed
7. When User #1 clicks "عرض السجل", they see both completed matches with their compatibility scores

## Technical Details

- **Feedback Storage**: All feedback responses are stored for potential future analysis
- **Completion Tracking**: Simple boolean tracking of which rounds each participant has completed
- **Performance**: Indexes added for efficient querying
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality remains unchanged
